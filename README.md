# Client Bitcoin tracker (Work in progress)

Front end that only displays the graph with the bitcoin price chart for the moment. 

**Remaining work:**
1. Implement an authentification component after backend is done with it.
2. Improve chart visibility (Timestamp takes a lot of place for the given information)
3. Implement a Vue route to display the current bitcoin data table (need another backend route and query for the backend)
4. Vuetify the front to get a better design
